          <h2>Welcome to My Literary World</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, and welcome to RoughNotes. I'm someone who loves to read and write poems, 
            though I'm not a professional writer by any means. This is simply my corner of the 
            internet where words find their home and stories come to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sometimes share my personal experiences as well, weaving them into stories and poems 
            that reflect the beauty and complexity of everyday life. Writing has become my way of 
            making sense of the world around me, one word at a time.
          </p>

          <h2>Why I Created This Space</h2>
          <p>
            I created this page because at times I just want to share things, but I don't know 
            with whom to share them. There's something magical about putting your thoughts into 
            words and releasing them into the world, hoping they might resonate with someone, 
            somewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe you've felt that way too—having thoughts, feelings, or stories that feel too 
            precious to keep locked away, yet too personal to share with just anyone. This space 
            is for those moments, those quiet revelations that deserve to be heard.
          </p>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>My Writing Journey</h2>
          <p>
            My love for words began with reading. Books were my escape, my teachers, my friends 
            during quiet afternoons. Slowly, I discovered that creating those worlds myself 
            brought even greater joy than discovering them in others' work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find inspiration everywhere—in conversations overheard on buses, in the way morning 
            light filters through my window, in the small moments that make up our days. Life is 
            full of stories waiting to be told, and I'm grateful to have found a way to share 
            some of them with you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
          <p>
            This space is home to my stories and poems, ranging from gentle fiction to personal 
            reflections, often exploring themes of connection, discovery, and the magic hidden 
            in everyday life. Some pieces come from my imagination, others from my own experiences 
            walking through this beautiful, complicated world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope my words resonate with you, inspire you, or simply provide a moment of 
            connection in your day. Thank you for taking the time to visit and read. Your 
            presence here means more than you know.
